**1. Build a pipeline for the following:  
   1. Read from a csv file at a given location. (Copy the below data into a csv file)


      customer_name,company

      suri,meta

      akki,google


   2. Input the values for a row into a script (prompt template)  
      1. customer name  
      2. company  
   3. Save the script into a .txt file with id as ‘Script123’  
   4. Write a cron job which triggers a call at an inputted time and date with the following parameters:  
      1. Script Id (which you created above)  
      2. customer Name  
      3. company  
      4. kwargs (any args that may come in)  
      5. Assume a /call api exists  
2. Use a python class based approach to create a class called Agent.  
   1. Use attributes and methods to build this out.**
